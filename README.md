## CRA TEMPLATE

**Hello! Hello!**\
Welcome to cra-template-lennie a React-query and Tailwind powered template for Create React App.

Do you like <span style="color:red">[React-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview "React Query")</span> for global server state management?\
Are you a fan of <span style="color:red">[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation, "TailwindCSS")</span>, the best utility-first CSS framework in the galaxy?\
Do you fancy <span style="color:red">[Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)</span> over fetch API for REST API requests?\
Are you interested in the [scintillating concoction](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-styled-components)</span> of [styled-components](https://styled-components.com/docs)</span> and Tailwind CSS?\
Or are you tired of project structures that are agonizing to maintain or extend?

If your answer is yes to all (or some<sup>infinity</sup>) of the above, then you are in the right galaxy.

Just run the command **_npx create-react-app --template lennie_** when initializing your React project and you are good to go.

### Important dependencies that comes with template by default
